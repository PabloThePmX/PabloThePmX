# Hi there, I'm Pablo! 👻

To be really honest with you, I kinda don't know what to write here, but well... I can say that I usually work with C# and a low code language called GeneXus.

## About my future 🐾
* Enhance my skills with WPF and ASP.NET Core.
* Maybe one day I'll learn more about frontend with Blazor!
* I could even try to learn some Unity maybe...
* And what about some C++?

## Quick facts about me 🎈
* Geography and History are topics that I really enjoy!
* I kinda want to learn a "not that common" REAL WORLD language, like finnish, russian, japanese or korean.
* I never played Resident Evil 4 on the PS2... but one day I will, I promise!
