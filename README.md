# Hi there, I'm Pablo! 👻

To be really honest with you, I kinda don't know what to write here, but well... I can say that I usually work with C# and a low code language called GeneXus.

## About my future 🐾
* Enhance my skills with WPF and ASP.NET Core (specially MVC).
* Study some Blazor!
* I'm also thinking about learning some Unity...

## Quick facts about me 🎈
* Geography and History are topics that I really enjoy!
* I kinda want to learn a "not that common" REAL WORLD language, like Finnish, Russian, Japanese or Korean.
