# Hi there, I'm Pablo! 👻

To be really honest with u, I kinda don't know what to write here, but well... I can say that I usually work with C# and a low code language called GeneXus.

## About my future 🐾
* Maybe one day I'll learn more about frontend with blazor.
* I could even try to learn some Unity maybe...
* And what about C++?
